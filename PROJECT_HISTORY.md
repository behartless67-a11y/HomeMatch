## Development Timeline

### Session 1: Project Migration & UI Improvements

#### Initial State
- Started with a Vite + React + TypeScript setup
- Had basic swipe functionality but UI changes weren't rendering properly
- Old Vite setup in `frontend/` directory

#### Major Migration: Vite → Next.js
**Why we migrated:**
- Next.js provides better hot reload (UI changes appear instantly)
- More reliable development experience
- File-based routing with App Router
- Server-side rendering capabilities
- Similar to your successful BattenSpaceFrontEnd project

**What was migrated:**
1. **Project Structure** - Moved from Vite to Next.js 15 with App Router
2. **Configuration Files:**
   - Created `next.config.js` - Next.js configuration with static export
   - Created `tailwind.config.js` - Tailwind CSS v3 setup
   - Created `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with path aliases (@/*)
   - Created `postcss.config.js` - PostCSS with Tailwind & Autoprefixer

3. **Directory Structure:**
   ```

   ├── next.config.js
   ├── tailwind.config.js
   ├── tsconfig.json
   └── package.json
   ```

4. **All Components Updated:**
   - Added 'use client' directives for client-side interactivity
   - Updated imports to use Next.js path aliases (@/)
   - Preserved all existing functionality

### UI Enhancements

#### 1. Image Size Increase
**Changes made to PropertyCard.tsx:**
- Card width: `w-80` (320px) → `w-[600px]` (600px)
- Image height: `h-48` (192px) → `h-[500px]` (500px)
- Navigation arrows: Increased size and improved positioning
- **Result:** Images are now 2.5x larger with better visual impact

#### 2. Background & Branding
**Added visual elements:**
- Background image: `requirements-to-buy-a-house.webp` at 20% opacity
- Logo: `background_removed_image_m0lDDGK1TF22UDLF_25ifg.png` → `logo.png`
- Logo sizing: Increased from h-16 (64px) to h-48 (192px) - 3x larger
- Removed header bar for cleaner, more spacious design

#### 3. No-Scroll Layout
**Viewport optimization:**
- Main container: `h-screen overflow-hidden` - fits perfectly in viewport
- No scrolling required - everything visible at once
- Responsive layout with flexbox centering

---

### UX Improvements

#### Welcome Screen & Onboarding Flow
**Problem:** Users were seeing random properties before setting preferences

**Solution - New User Flow:**
1. **Welcome Screen** (First Visit)
   - Large logo display
   - Welcome message explaining HomeMatch
   - "Set My Preferences" call-to-action button

2. **Preferences Modal** (Opens automatically)
   - Price range sliders
   - Bedroom/bathroom minimums
   - Property type selection (house, condo, townhouse, apartment)
   - State filters
   - Must-have features checkboxes

3. **Property Browsing** (After preferences set)
   - Only shows properties matching criteria
   - Can adjust filters anytime via ⚙ Filters button
   - Much better first impression

**Implementation:**
- Added `hasSetPreferences` state tracking
- Conditional rendering based on preference state
- Preferences required before showing properties

- Preference filtering system
- Welcome screen conditional rendering
- Property navigation and actions

**Property display:**
- Image carousel with navigation arrows
- Property details (price, location, bed/bath/sqft)
- Action buttons (Pass / Love)
- Optimized for 600x500px images

### 3. PreferencesModal.tsx
**Filter interface:**
- Price range inputs
- Bedroom/bathroom minimums
- Multi-select property types
- Multi-select states
- Multi-select features
- Saves to parent component state

### 4. LikedPropertiesView.tsx
**Saved properties grid:**

## Design Decisions

### Why Next.js over Vite?
1. Better hot reload - changes appear instantly
2. More stable development experience
3. Familiar to team (BattenSpaceFrontEnd uses Next.js)
4. Built-in routing, optimizations, and SSR capabilities

### Why Static Export?
- Simpler deployment (no server required)
- Can host on GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, S3
- Faster load times
- Lower hosting costs

### Why Preferences-First Flow?
- Better user experience - relevant properties from start
- Reduces frustration from irrelevant listings
- Guides users to think about their needs
- Increases engagement and satisfaction

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations
- Mock data only (30 properties)

### Technical Debt
- Old Vite frontend still in `frontend/` directory (can be removed)
- Backup file `mockProperties.backup.ts` (can be removed)
- Image URLs hardcoded (should use Next.js Image component)
